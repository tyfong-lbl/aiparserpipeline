+Ask me one yes or no question at a time so we can develop a thorough step by step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to ahve a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time. For context look at the kagidocs.html file to understand the API. Here's the idea: I want to generate searches to feed to the kagi search API. I have a set of searches with variables in them, and an excel file with values for the variables. I want to create a tool that will take the excel file values and plug them into the searches and output the results to another excel file. The search should yield URLs and page titles.

+Yes the tool should preserve the original input columns/variables in the output file. The query should show with the results in the output.

# 2025-05-19 17:20:59.267054
+For multitemplate rows, teh results should be grouped as independent entries in the output file.

+Combined into one row with multiple result columns.

# 2025-05-19 17:22:54.200947

+A, skip failed searches and continue processing, logging errors separately

# 2025-05-19 17:24:55.660573
+Tool should include metadata that you discussed above.

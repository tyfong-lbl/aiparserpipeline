# Configuration Setting Proposals for O3mini

This document evaluates several proposals for making configuration settings easier to manage within our project.

## Option 1: Embedding User-Settable Variables in main()
In this approach, settings are declared as variables at the beginning of main() that users can modify directly.
**Pros:**
- Simple to implement and understand.
- No extra files required.
**Cons:**
- Changes require code edits.
- Not ideal for non-technical users.

## Option 2: Using a Separate Settings File
Store configuration in an external file (e.g., YAML) that users can edit without modifying the code.
**Pros:**
- Easy to update configurations without touching code.
- Supports multiple environments (development, production, etc.).
**Cons:**
- Introduces an extra dependency (YAML parser) and file management overhead.

## Option 3: Command Line Arguments with a Shell Script Wrapper
In this approach, configurations are passed as command line arguments. A shell script can be created to set environment variables and command line parameters to run the program.
**Pros:**
- Highly flexible for one-off runs and automation.
- No need for code changes for different runs.
**Cons:**
- Can be cumbersome with many arguments.
- Less user-friendly for those not comfortable with the command line.

## Proposed Hybrid Approach
A hybrid configuration system is recommended that leverages:
1. A YAML configuration file for default settings, letting users easily modify parameters without changing code.
2. Environment variables for sensitive data such as API keys.
3. Command line arguments to override settings where necessary.
4. An optional shell script wrapper to orchestrate running the application with proper settings.

## Implementation Outline
- **Step 1:** Create a `config/` directory with YAML files (e.g., default.yaml, development.yaml, production.yaml, config.example.yaml).
- **Step 2:** Modify main.py to load configurations from YAML using a helper function (e.g., load_config()).
- **Step 3:** Extend the argparse setup to accept the path to a configuration file and command line overrides.
- **Step 4:** Ensure environment variables (e.g., API keys) are prioritized for sensitive information.
- **Step 5:** Optionally, create a shell script (e.g., run_script.sh) that sets environment variables and runs main.py with the desired configuration.

## Conclusion
Each approach offers its own benefits and limitations. The hybrid approach is recommended for balancing ease of use, flexibility, and security. This design allows non-technical users to configure settings via a simple YAML file while giving advanced users the option to fine-tune runtime behavior using command line arguments and shell scripts.

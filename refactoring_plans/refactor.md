# Web Scraping Timeout Issue Refactoring Plan

## Problem Analysis

The application is experiencing timeout errors when attempting to scrape web pages using Playwright. Even though users can access these pages normally in their browsers, the automated scraping process fails with 30-second timeouts. This suggests several potential issues:

1. **Bot Detection**: Websites may be identifying the scraper as an automated tool and blocking or throttling access
2. **Headless Browser Limitations**: The headless browser configuration may not be properly handling complex web pages
3. **Resource Loading**: The scraper may be failing to load necessary resources or JavaScript components
4. **Missing Authentication**: Some sites may require cookies, session data, or specific headers
5. **Inefficient Error Handling**: The current code may not properly handle or recover from partial failures

## High-Level Refactoring Strategy

Our refactoring plan focuses on five key areas:

### 1. Browser Configuration Enhancement
- Configure the browser with more realistic settings
- Add proper user agent strings and headers
- Adjust viewport and other browser parameters

### 2. Page Navigation Improvements
- Implement multiple loading strategies
- Add mechanisms to bypass common obstacles (cookie notices, popups)
- Create progressive content extraction fallbacks

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Add graceful degradation for partial content
- Ensure proper resource cleanup

### 4. Debugging Capabilities
- Add screenshot and HTML capture for failed pages
- Enhance logging for better troubleshooting
- Create diagnostic tools for problematic URLs

### 5. Data Processing Resilience
- Make the parser more tolerant of partial or imperfect content
- Improve the data pipeline to handle edge cases
- Add validation steps to ensure data quality

## Line-by-Line Edit Instructions

### File: page_tracker.py

1. Enhance the `AiParser.initialize` method to use more browser-like settings
2. Add a new `set_realistic_browser` helper method after the `initialize` method
3. Completely rewrite the `select_article_to_api` method to include:
   - Multiple retry attempts
   - Different page loading strategies
   - Cookie banner/popup handling
   - Multiple content extraction methods
   - Better error handling
4. Add a new `debug_url` method for capturing screenshots and HTML of problematic pages
5. Update the `get_api_response` method to handle partial or malformed content
6. Modify the `strip_markdown` method to be more tolerant of unexpected formats
7. Enhance the `ModelValidator.get_responses_for_url` method to include debugging and better error reporting
8. Update the `ModelValidator.get_all_url_responses` method to handle failed requests more gracefully
9. Improve the `ModelValidator.consolidate_responses` method to handle edge cases and partial data

### File: multi_project_validator.py

10. Enhance the `process_project` method to include better error handling and recovery
11. Update the `_load_excel_data` method to handle malformed or missing data
12. Modify the `process_all_projects` method to continue despite individual project failures
13. Enhance the `_save_checkpoint` method to be more robust against serialization errors
14. Update the `run` method to provide better progress reporting and error handling

### File: main.py

15. Add command-line arguments for timeout configuration and debug mode
16. Create a global configuration mechanism for page loading parameters
17. Add a debug directory creation step for storing diagnostic information
18. Enhance the error handling in the main function
19. Add more detailed logging throughout the execution process
20. Create a mechanism to pass configuration from main.py to the page_tracker module

## Implementation Benefits

This refactoring approach will:

1. **Improve Success Rate**: By making the scraper more resilient and browser-like
2. **Enhance Diagnostics**: By providing better tools to identify and fix problematic URLs
3. **Increase Robustness**: By handling partial failures gracefully
4. **Maintain Data Quality**: By ensuring the parser can work with imperfect content
5. **Simplify Troubleshooting**: By providing detailed logs and diagnostic information

The changes focus on making the web scraping process more robust while maintaining the existing functionality and data processing pipeline.

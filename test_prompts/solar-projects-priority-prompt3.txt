Analyze the text pasted below to determine if the solar projects called ${PROJECT} is mentioned in the text, and if so, the attributes of the ${PROJECT} project that is mentioned.  Based on your analysis, output a JSON dictionary, wherein the dictionary attributes are selected from the following list:  
- cost: A summary of costs to build the project with detail on the component costs, if available
- cost_yr: The date or year that the cost was reported
- gen_dc: Nameplate power generation capacity in MW-DC. If there is not enough information to determine that the capacity is in terms of MW-DC instead of MW-AC or another unit, output null.
- gen_ac: Nameplate power generation capacity in MW-AC. If there is not enough information to determine that the capacity is in terms of MW-DC instead of MW-AC or another unit, output null.
- gen_unknown: Nameplate power generation capacity and units (e.g., MW, MVar, kW), where it is unknown or not specified whether the units are in AC or DC terms
Output only the JSON dictionary according to these instructions. Do not output any other commentary or description. If there is not enough information available for an attribute, output null for that attribute.
